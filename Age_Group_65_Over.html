    <h1>Educational Attainment in the US, California, Pasadena (CA) by Age Demographic</h1>

    <div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            This visualization displays educational attainment for 65 year olds and older in the US, California, and
            Pasadena (CA). From this chart, similar to the 35 to 44 and 45 to 64 year old age groups, we can observe
            that Pasadena and the United States have a similar percentage of their populations graduate from high
            school, while California lags behind. Pasadena also has a significantly higher percentage of its population
            graduate from undergraduate college compared to both California and the US. Additionally, educational
            attainment levels in Pasadena increased from 2021 to 2022 while educational attainment levels stayed
            relatively similar in California and the US. Lastly, similar to the 45 to 64 year old age group, educational
            attainment levels on average are lower for the 65 year old and older age group compared to the younger age
            groups.
