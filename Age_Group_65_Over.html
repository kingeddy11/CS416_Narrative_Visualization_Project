    <h1>Educational Attainment in the US, California, Pasadena (CA) by Age Demographic</h1>

    <div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            This interactive visualization compares educational attainment in the United States, California, and
            Pasadena (CA). More specifically, we analyze the percentage of the population in each region with at least a
            high school diploma and the percentage of the population with at least a bachelor's degree across four
            different age groups. Additionally, you can choose between examining educational attainment in 2022 and 2021
            for these regions. We would like to observe whether Pasadena has a higher educational attainment level
            compared to statewide and nationwide levels.
