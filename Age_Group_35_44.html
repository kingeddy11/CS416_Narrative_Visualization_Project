    <h1>Educational Attainment in the US, California, Pasadena (CA) by Age Demographic</h1>

    <div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            This visualization displays educational attainment for 35 to 44 year olds in the US, California, and
            Pasadena (CA). From this chart, we can observe that Pasadena and the United States have a similar percentage
            of their populations graduate from high school, while California lags behind. However, Pasadena has a
            significantly higher percentage of its population graduate from undergraduate college compared to both
            California and the US. Additionally, the percentage of Pasadena's population graduating from undergraduate
            college significantly decreased from 2021 to 2022. Educational attainment levels for both California and the
            US were relatively unchanged from 2021 to 2022 as well as the percentage of Pasadena's population graduating
            from high school.
